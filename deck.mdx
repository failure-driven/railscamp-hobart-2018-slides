rails camp.

## Core findings

```notes
Just a brain dump
- Pairing
  - we were surprised at the variety of pairing ideas
  - a lot of people don't pair :(
  - pair with juniors or just to nut out a problem
  - we believe in co-creative output as pairing
  - don't wear out your pair
  - a lot of people are control freaks
  - only pair for learning
  - many miss the point that the whole can be greater then the sum of the
    parts.
- Testing
  - people need more guidance in that
- Working on master
  - lots of opinions - most didn't agree with ours
- Technology
  - a diverse understanding and interest, being web app developers using Ember
    we couldn't wait to get our hands on react but lot's of others were
    treating it like just another fad
- Encouragement
  - amazaing how peopel where intimidated by us
  - we were intimidated by lot's of others
  - our finding? "dont' be" we are all nice people
  - one of the best way is to co-create some code, less intimidating then
    asking to see someone elses code, this way you are also in full
    understanding why something was written, not judgmental, it unfolds in
    front of you.

- courage to be vulnerable - with meeting people with sharing your code
- bring your code to others
- pairing for learning
- insight into testing, pairing, different companies
- so much to learn - be open to pick up tips and tricks
- for next time: share your code, don't wait for others to start the
  conversation, talk in code - encourage others to type

```
