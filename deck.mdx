# #TheRailsCampProject

<Notes>

**Selena** Hey michael,  
I've got this great idea,  
you know how we built that app to practice BDD  

**Michael** yeah  

**Selena** you know how we were going to rebuild it to affirm what we think we
know

**Michael** yeah

**Selena** and there has been general talk how the amount of coding at
railscamp seems to be on the decline  Let's kill 2 birds with 1 stone and
rebuild the app at rails camp, getting all the campers involved.

**Michael** Fuck yeah, you're a genius,  
I mean, that's a great idea but ... does everyone here know what rails camp is?

# What is RailsCamp?

<Notes>

**Selena**

What is Rails Camp? Great question.

Think back to your high school days. It's like a high school camp.

Bunk beds in the bush out in the middle of nowhere, often with one or two
outdoor activities - like flying fox, canoeing or hikes

Being in the middle of nowhere, there's often no internet

Sounds a bit a funny - a bunch of developers who get together and go camping
without internet

But the general idea is that people bring along their computers and a project
to work

No internet encourages people to collaborate and work through problems together

# We love rails camp!

<Notes>

**Michael**

We are super passionate about coding

rails camp gives us an opportunity to spend undivided time on something we love
doing, we are passionate about - writing code

no kids, no preparing food, no distractions

just time to learn stuff, practice skills and share ideas with fellow
developers

I have been to over 10 rails camps and each time I come back rejuvenated from a
coding skill perspective

a bit like a meditation retreat but with code

It is also a huge opportunity to collaborate with a diverse group of developers

from juniors and people doing coder camp intensives who will be looking for
jobs in 6 months

to Tech leaders of banks and their insights

**basically: **code, sleep, eat, repeat!

# What we set out to do?

<Notes>

**Selena**

That's right!

And although we're super excited about being able to get away and just code for 4
days straight, not everyone shares the same view.

Two camps ago there were a lot of people who didn't write any
code, which I personally think is a wasted opportunity.

I remember when I was starting out, learning to code. I didn't want to miss any opportunity
to code - especially when there was an opportunity to code with industry experts!

After that camp, there was a lot of talk in the ruby community about the
gradual decline of coding at rails camps and a number of people seemed
generally unhappy about it. But no one seemed to have an idea of how to resolve
it

As we mentioned at the start of this presentation, Michael and I have been coding quite a bit
in our own time to try and better understand the testing processes we implement in our day job at Fresho!

The best way to understand code is to write code! So we built a game using Rails/React frameworks
And we always intended to rebuild it 3 or 4 times

<Notes>

[SLIDE] Jess

**Selena**

But with morning coffee one day and a sudden strike of genius - I had the idea to take the project to Rails Camp
and run through it, trippling with all teh campers.

After-all, the highest level of understanding is to be able to teach someone else and have
them understand what your talking about.

Not only would we fill our own self-ish goal of learning but we if we could manage to pair with every person at
camp, then we may also succeed in startin to set the culture of rails camp back on track with a focus of actually
coding.

**Michael**

Ultimately this would lead us to improve Fresho! processes from testing to team
collaboration and pairing

<Notes>

[SLIDE] Keith

**Michael**

What we actually did - well this actually morphed as we went along but
basically:

paired, or trippled with every participant

what is pairing? co working on a problem with someone else 2 developers 1
keyboard

go up to person without too much intimidation and get them to work with us
bring them up to speed with context: writing a game, test driven, rails and
react

Selena would get me to get my hands off the keyboard

encourage person to write the next failing test or implement code to make a
test pass fun lolcommit

interview them about the experience

<Notes>

[SLIDE] Matt

**Selena**


This was not only an opportunity for me to teach more Junior people but also an
opportunity to direct more senior people and feel less intimidated by their
level of experience, knowledge etc - a hurdle that can be difficult to overcome in the workplace

I gained an incredible amount of confidence in collaborating and sharing thoughts/ideas

And (much to Michael's delight - if you've ever heard his VI talk you know what I'm talking about)
I mastered some new VI shortcuts! And have even imparted that knowledge since on avid vim users! #winning

It was also great to get a broad overview, working with a range of people.
I've had a relatively short career so far, so I hadn't really experienced what it's like to work
with such different individuals on coding problems.

[SLIDE] Laurence

**Michael**

it gave me a reason to reach out to everyone at camp

have a conversation around testing, pairing, team dynamics and developer
practices

even the people I felt intimidated by, there was no choice Selena said we have
to pair with everyone

it was intense training on how to pair with people better, I did it 36 times
and had a coach looking over my shoulder telling me where to improve after each
pairing session

We were also challenged in various ways by people and their understanding which
brought out the best in us

on how to tackle a problem

how to write a test

work collaboratively

We pushed each other and continued on, pairing with a bunch more people till we
looked up and saw everyone had gone to bed. It was 3am.

By Sunday afternoon, word got around and people got excited asking us when it
is going to be their turn and lingering around to have a go

People were more keen to pull out their laptops.

We noticed seniors who would go out of their way to help juniors which we'd
pointed out after working with us

The whole camp was buzzing for us to finish our project and get camp-wide
participation, even bringing dinner and snacks to us because there was no time
to line up for meals!

# What did we Achieve?

<Notes>

**Michael**

What did we achieve? clearly we built an awesome app with the help of all the
best developers from all the cool companies around Australia?

**Selena**

Best developers for sure! Bringing developers up to speed with our pairing practices, test
practices and the app is hard enough. let alone when you do pair swaps every 30
minutes!

**Michael**

With all these best practices we would have written great code at least?

**Selena**

haha! to write good software you actually need to plan and architect a
solution, get everyone on board and then build it at a steady pace. We did get
a lot of great pointers especially from the Up banking guys as to security
issues with our app and we learn a lot of tips and tricks from everyone.

**Michael**

Well at least we spread the message of Multi layer Outside in Behaviour Driven
Design and pairing

**Selena**

I think we did!
And we had a lot of great conversations around how we do testing and pairing and how that
compares to everyone else in their companies.

Also everyone at Rails Camp 24 in Hobart wrote some code that is committed on github! Win!

# What did we learn?

<Notes>

**Michael**

What did we learn?

**Selena**

That pair swaps are a necessary thing - after 36 hours pairing with you on the
weekend we were made to pair at work for the next 2 days and it wasn't pretty.

**Michael**

That they did. We also learnt how other people pair, their view on testing and
their view on developing a new feature in an app.

**Selena**

Through the weekend we also learnt a lot of "developer empathy" how to share
experiences and code with not only your coding buddy but with wider developers
that come to rails camp and that it can be done through acutall coding and not
just playing werewolf.

**Michael**

So we ultimately reached our goal of making the most of the time at rails camp
to code and share code with others, any tips?

</ul>

<Notes>

sharing code can be intimidating - don't ask someone to show me your code, ask
to build together and have the experience together, as some company value
states "have the courage to be vulnerable"

Be willing to start the conversation, don't expect that somone will come to
you. Also don't be intimidated by other people in the room, everyone is happy
to code together, at least for 30 minutes.

There are a lot of tips and tricks that developers know, be open to pick these
up, be open to try new things, from new editors, workflows, key bindings,
development processess.

Have fun and try pairing, coding is not all about headphones on and sitting in
a corner and social experiences with developers do not need to be just chats,
werewolf and drinking, you can be coding at the same time.

lolcommits help with that
